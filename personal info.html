I’m a first-year student that took Bachelor of Science in Information System at Jose Rizal Memorial State University. </p> 
<p>My parents are Arlene and Benjemen Aballe. My mother is house wife while my father is a farmer at the same time is an automotive to provide financial support for me and for my sister. 
I have only one sister named Lenie E. Aballe, she is now in 4th grade at Guinabucan Elementary School.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things that I like and a few things that I don’t like. I like having fun with friends and going somewhere with them. Sometimes I also prefer to stay at home and watched some videos in my cellphone.</p>
<p>I also love watching vlogs, lifestyle videos in YouTube or Tiktok and apply that knowledge to myself. The thing I don’t like is when someone bothers me and I’m doing important matter that’s the thing that really gets me mad. </p>
<p>It not easy for me to be away from them but I can handle it for the sake of my dreams. I’m doing my best to achieve my goals and to become successful someday by the help of our almighty God. </p>
